Diodes have many applications one of their common use is in the design of rectifiers (which convert ac to dc) is the most common. The terminal characteristic of the ideal diode can be like this: If a negative voltage is applied to the diode, no current flows and the diode behaves as an open circuit. Diodes operated in this mode are said to be reverse biased, or operated in the reverse direction. An ideal diode has zero current when operated in the reverse direction and is said to be cut off. s
