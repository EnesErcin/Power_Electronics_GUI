```
1- **-Ltspice software (Analog Devices)** 
-   All the data for charactersitic behaviour are generated from ltspice simulation

2- **-Qt Designer Software**
-   Enabled us to generate GUI script and display on screen from python interpreter.

3- **-Ltspy3** 
-   Open source code that decode the binary data which is genereted from ltspice executable and dumped the gathered data as numpy array to desired variable.

4 -**-Numpy and Matplotlib**
-   Allowed us to do accurate and convinent matrix calculations as well as display the data on graphs.

5 -**-Sedra Smith MicroElectronic Circuits**
-   Gathered reliable and accurate information about power electronic components.

6- **-Danial Hart Power Electronic Circuits**
-   Gathered reliable and accurate information about power electronic circuits and components.

This was a group project for a programming course and their contributations should be mentioned as they helped me to understand more about ltspice software and qtDesigner.
